# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III — Notes & Intuition

**LeetCode #123** | Dynamic Programming | Hard

---

## Problem

Given prices[], make at most 2 transactions (buy→sell, buy→sell).
Cannot hold 2 positions simultaneously. Find maximum profit.

```
[3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]  →  6   (buy@0,sell@3, buy@1,sell@4)
[1,2,3,4,5]        →  4   (single transaction buy@1,sell@5)
[7,6,4,3,1]        →  0   (no profitable trade)
```

## Why Not Greedy?

With k=2 limit, taking an early small profit may block a larger combined gain.
Greedy fails — we need DP to track how many transactions we've used.

---

## 4-State DP

Track the best portfolio value at each of 4 stages:

```
buy1  — after buying  for the 1st time  (initialised to MIN_VALUE: "not bought yet")
sell1 — after selling for the 1st time
buy2  — after buying  for the 2nd time
sell2 — after selling for the 2nd time  ← final answer
```

```java
buy1  = max(buy1,  -price)         // buy at cheapest
sell1 = max(sell1, buy1 + price)   // sell for best gain
buy2  = max(buy2,  sell1 - price)  // 2nd buy "funded" by 1st profit
sell2 = max(sell2, buy2 + price)   // 2nd sell
```

---

## The Key Insight: `buy2 = sell1 - price`

`sell1 - price` means: "I made `sell1` profit from the first transaction,
and now I'm spending `price` for the second buy."

This effectively chains the two transactions — `sell2` captures their
combined profit automatically.

## Why Updating In-Order Is Safe

In one pass, updating buy1→sell1→buy2→sell2 is correct because:
- `buy1` at price[i] = best buy on days 0..i ✓
- `sell1` = best sell using best buy from 0..i ✓
- `buy2` = best 2nd buy after best 1st transaction up to day i ✓
- `sell2` = best 2nd sell using above ✓

Each update uses the freshest state from the current day — safe because
we want "the best possible" for each state considering today.

| price | buy1 | sell1 | buy2 | sell2 |
|-------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 3 | -3 | 0 | -3 | 0 |
| 3 | -3 | 0 | -3 | 0 |
| 5 | -3 | 2 | -3 | 2 |
| 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 5 |
| 1 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 5 |
| 4 | 0 | 4 | 2 | **6** |

Result: `6` ✓
